Mephisto, also known as the Fallen Savior, is an Overlord who rules over Hell. She is the successor of the third Devil King, taking back the power that was rightfully hers. Her followers, what few there are, admire her absolute power over the magic of the world.

# Personality
---
Very few have ever spoken directly to Mephisto, but those who have tell of how dismissive and tactless she actually is.

# Followers' Beliefs and Behaviors
---
Those who follow Mephisto are generally powerful magic users or Vampires.  Her status as the "Goddess of magic" leads even non-religious mages to pray to her in times of need.

The Church of Mephisto, founded after the Fall of the Old Religion, worships Mephisto, the Fallen Savior. The church has two key values: true equality and accountability. In the eyes of the church, Mephisto's role as the Grim Reaper proves that each mortal is treated equal in death and, therefore, should be treated equal in life. The value does not manifest in a form of socialism or communism, but instead forms as the tendency for the follower's of the church to treat the homeless, commoner's, and nobles in the same way. This treatment extends to the other value of the church, accountability. The church views each action of someone to be worthy of judgement, no mater how generous, and the summation of the judgements will determine the fate of the person. If a tyrant king slaughters 10,000 people, then, in the eyes of the church, the tyrant king would have to foster new life of 10,000 people or the equivalent of.
