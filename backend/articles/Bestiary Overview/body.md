# Classes of Creatures
Each creature is a given a class ranging from Common, the least dangerous, to Eldritch, the most dangerous. These classifcations are used to determine how large of a force is required to deal with any singular creature. The classes are as follow:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Calamity/Heroic
* Mythical
* Eldritch

 
# Example Classifications
## Calamity
* Death Knight (Duelist)
* Elemental Giant (Titan)

 
## Mythical
* Archon (varies)
* Elemental Titan (Titan)
* Lich (Titan Slayer)
* Fallen Titan (Titan)
* Kraken (Titan)

## Eldritch
* Demon Lord (varies)
* Leviathan (Titan)
* Chaos Dragon (Titan)

 
## Beyond Eldritch
Ovelords and Ravagers are the only creatures who transcend Eldritch creatures in terms of strength. Though the appearance of a Ravager is exceedingly rare, they do occur.  

# D&D Note:
The classifications correspond, vaguely, to the following CR levels.  
* Common => CR 5 and below
* Uncommon => CR 5 to CR 10
* Rare => CR 10 to CR 15
* Calamity => CR 15 to CR 20
* Mythical => CR 20 to CR 30
* Eldritch => CR 30 and up
