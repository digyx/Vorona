# Overview

Before the existence of angels, demons, or devils, there were only human and the Lost. To escape execution by the Lost, some humans ventured underground. over the course of centuries, these humans evolved to have incredible muscular strength, smaller than average height, and heightened eyesight in the dark, eventually transforming into a new species called Dwarves. These dwarves found new and unique metals and crystals that they experimented with, eventually creating electricity and basic machinery. Even after the passing of the Lost, Dwarves continued to stay underground, unaffiliated with the overworld religions and instead opting to pledge their allegiance to science instead. This unaffiliation lead to very few drawves being able to cast magic, and those few who could were generally look at with skepticism and, occassionally, disgust at their apparent disrespect for scientific advancement. 

Though they were formerly humans, dwarves rarely shared any of the scientific knowledge with surface dwellers. Dwarvenkind feared that their advancements would be used for causing suffering though war instead of used to advance society as a whole. The only other race which resides underground, Vampires, do maintain a fairly healthy relationship with dwarves. The two began sharing their own knowledge, dwarves scientific and vampires artistic, around twenty years ago once the city of Nightrose grew to its current status as a city state.
