# Personality
---
Known as the Grim Reaper, Beelzebub is generally only seen by his followers and those crossing from life to death.  He resides within an ancient ruin somewhere in the world, guarded by powerful magic, staying away from the rest of humanity.  Beelzebub views himself more as a force of nature than as a Deity to be worshiped.  His cold heartedness and apathy are his defining traits. 

# Followers' Beliefs and Behaviors
---
The Reapers themselves are a group of elite followers of Beelzebub who spend their days helping souls reincarnate. Once their lives expire, the Reapers transition into a Devil with a new, ageless body made of ether instead of flesh. Reapers themselves rarely interact with mortals outside of houses of worship of Beelzebub where they act as an archpriest. Beelzebub's followers view the word of a Reaper as the word of law since each Reaper is handpicked by Beelzebub himself. 

His followers view themselves as the police of the world, trained from birth to be elite warriors. They travel throughout the realm, eliminating those who go against the laws of nature and tinker with death itself. Liches are seen as the ultimate evil in the eyes of Beelzebub, and any that draw attention to themselves would meet a swift end.
