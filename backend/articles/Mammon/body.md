# Personality
Mammon is known to be the kindest and gentlest of the Demon Lords. He spends his days traveling the mortal realm, helping those in need, and trying to understand how mortals live. Though immortal, Mammon fakes aging to fit in better with those surrounding him. Over the course of several simulated lifetimes, he has never taken a wife or husband, but Mammon has taken on several apprentices and proteges and treated them as surrogate children. 

# Followers' Beliefs and Behaviors
Unlike the rest of the Demon Lords' followers, those who follow Mammon cherish knowledge over all else. They view fighting as nothing more than a meaningless encounter that has a negative outcome for both sides, no matter the victor. With this in mind, his followers strive to avoid violence by any means necessary, even if it means resorting to underhanded tactics to continue their research. They all are magically inclined, so the use of disguise magic is frequently used to avoid either themselves or a location being discovered by an unwelcome party. 

The Academy employs followers of Mammon, almost exclusively. This is not made by choice but because of the type of person and caliber of academics that his followers generally are. Other roles they fill are advisors to royalty, independent researchers, and independent instructors.
