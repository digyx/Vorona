# Overview
---
Millions of years ago, the Devil King and the Almighty waged war against the four Elemental Dragons, slaying three of them. The last dragon fled into hiding, only appearing once more in history. In an effort to ressurect the dragon race, alchemists and mages from across the realm attempted to illegally fuze lizards with humans. This lead to the creation of the Dragonkin, the failed experiments who were conscious, intelligent, and escaped execution by their creators. 

Over the course of thousands of years, Dragonkin developed their own culture and lifestyle. They are a very tribal species, living in smaller familial packs than in villages or cities. Generally, only a few dozen live in a single area. Tribes are generally twenty to thirty miles from each other, allowing enough space to be used as hunting grounds for each tribe. Every year, each Dragonkin tribe sends one representative to a meeting to discuss land distrubtion, trade agreements, and other political topics. Remembering their past of persecution, Dragonkin do their best to avoid conflict both within their race as well as with other races.
