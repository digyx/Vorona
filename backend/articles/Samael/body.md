# Personality
Samael is quite shy and introverted.  She keeps to herself and rarely interacts with mortals.  Being a blacksmith, she forges weapons for the other Demon Lords who are also her closest friends.  She maintains a very stable, peaceful relationship with them, especially Leviathan.  Samael treats her followers with respect, never demanding any reciprocated.  Living by example and being the change she seeks are two mantras that she lives by. 

# Followers' Beliefs and Behaviors
Blacksmiths, Druids, Elves, and those who are in tune with nature or the elements tend toward Samael as their Demon Lord of choice. Each one depends on or cherishes an element or all of nature itself for their livelihood. Followers may tend towards peace, but there are highly trained warriors in the ranks who take it upon themselves to guard the elements. Scouts patrol the dense forests in the north, looking for and persecuting any who dare disturb the silence of the woods, knights fight on the frontlines against the horrid army of the Fallen, and archers are posted across the realm at high traffic areas near areas of importance. 

Samael's followers rarely, if ever, ask for any assistance from her, yet they give their lives up for her. The very few times she has reached out to her followers, they took her word as law and followed each letter exactly as stated with no deviation. The most impressive feat of this group is not their strength, but their lack of leadership. Each indivual acts of their own accord with the only figure of power being Samael and her words.
