# Personality
Lilith, though the Lord of Desire, is a kind and compassionate Demon Lord. Her shy, reserved attitude is contrasted with her ambition to always better herself. Lilith is generally a pacifist, but if you hurt someone close to her, she will hunt you down and kill you. She treats her followers with the same respect she treats the other Demon Lords. Lilith does not make many pacts with her followers since a pact requires the pact holder to make a sacrifice to receive the blessing of a Demon Lord. 

# Followers' Beliefs and Behaviors
From birth, followers of Lilith are taught love and compassion for others as well as the willingness to sacrifice themselves to save those around them. They belief that Lilith will save their souls, allowing them to reincarnate in a better life than before. The vast majority of Lilith's followers came from poverty, barely having enough to survive. Followers train to be fighters from a young age at monasteries, growing up to become some of the most elite warriors in the realm. As stated before, dedicated followers of hers will try to make a pact with her to sacrifice parts of themselves in exchange for immense power. Though rare, the people who receive these pacts from Lilith are treated as prophets. Known powers range from basic magic spells to practical immortality. 

The Church of Lilith maintains a system of monasteries around the realm with the head of the Church of Lilith being in the town of Sutton. The monasteries are used as orphanages and training grounds for the monks. The orphans are taught the ways of Lilith and are given better than average schooling. Each pupil is assigned a personal mentor to act as their instructor and as a pseudo-parent to raise the child. On the child's 14th birthday, they will set out on a quest of their own to prove themselves as true followers of Lilith.
