# Personality
---
Leviathan is infamous for never showing his humanoid form. Whenever his followers call upon him, Leviathan instead appears in the form of a water serpent, speaking through telepathy. Followers generally only call upon him once, terrified after their first encounter.

Once per year, Leviathan rises from the sea in his serpent form, giving his followers guidance for the next year.

# Followers' Beliefs and Behaviors
---
Being most popular in the Shattered Abyss, followers of Leviathan are usually battle tested, hardened mortals who view life more as a war to be won than as something to be enjoyed.  Children of followers are taught to be kind to one another and treat everyone with respect since you never know who will help you in your greatest time of need.  Unlike the Church of Lilith or Church of Mephisto, there does not exist a formal organization, but the followers of Leviathan instead prefer to spread their religion through helping others than "shoving it onto others."

The most unique trait of followers of Leviathans is their ability to summon creatures from other dimensions.  These beings fight for their summoners without question and some even seem to have intelligence.  Generally, summoners attempt to bond with what they summon and train them to become formidable foes to the horrors of the tundra.
