# Overview
---
At the end of the Great War, all Demons, Devils, and Angels were expelled from their respective domains. Demons stayed Demons, Angels turned into Celestials, and Devils turned into Vampires. Vampires were few and far between before the Great War, primarily being the descendants of exiles. Vampires generally live underground in a single city, Nightrose, whose location is kept secret from overworlders. The city's leaders send out ambassadors to the largest settlements in the realm, Shadow's Heart, World's End, and the Kingdom of the Sky. Finding a vampire anywhere else in the world is extremely rare and usually means that the vampire in question was exiled from Nightrose.

Vampires are one of the few beings in the realm who are able to use Blood Arts, the others being Devils and those who have pledged their souls to Mephisto. Vampires are not able to regenerate blood, so they must consume it instead. This has lead to humanoid races donating blood to Nightrose in exchange for large sums of money or military power.
