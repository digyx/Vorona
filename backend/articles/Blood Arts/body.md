Blood Arts are the magic incantations used by Vampires and those who pledged their lives to the Nightmare Queen, Mephisto.  Blood Arts work by using blood instead of ether as the catalyst for the magical reaction.

**D&D Note:**  Each blood art costs one action to cast.  Each pint of blood corresponds to 1/5 of a character's health or 35 HP, whichever is less.  The flavour text is just an exmaple, each Blood Art can be cast by releasing blood from anywhere on the body, not necessarily in the specific location mentioned in the text.

## 1. Blood Storm
A stream of blood runs from the caster's veins and begins swirling in the air around the caster, dispersing into a a mist that cuts into anyone standing within 15ft of the caster, and lasts for up to a minute, costing a pint of blood.

**D&D Note:** Deals (1/2 level)d6 damage to every creature within a 15 ft radius at the end of each creature's turn.

## 2. Vermilion Guard
Blood seeps out of the caster's veins, protecting them from any attacks, costing half a pint of blood per hit.

**D&D Note:** This completely blocks every attack that hits.

## 3. Sanguine Thirst
The caster slits his throat.  The blood shoots out like a spike, plunging directly into their opponent.  If the spike misses, then another will shoot out.  This cycle repeats until the caster decides to stop.

**D&D Note:**  The caster decides how much health they would like to wager.  The caster will then flip a coin.  Heads, the attack hits and the caster heals for that amount of health.  Tails, the attack misses and the caster loses that amount of health.

## 4. Crimson Blade
Right before each strike, the caster runs their weapon across their wrists.  Blood pours out, coating the blade, and hardening into an incredibly sharp edge.  As the blade breaks the enemy's skin, the blood erupts into flames.

**D&D Note:** Deals (1/2 level)d12 damage per hit, replacing the damage dealt by the weapon.  Costs an equivalent amount of health points per hit.

## 5. Ruby Mist
Blood encases the caster and then immediately disperses.  The blood then flies over to a different location, forming back into the shape of the caster.

**D&D Note:** Teleports the caster up to 100 ft per pint of blood in any direction that they can see or have seen in the past.  Cast as a bonus action.

## 6. Nightrose
Unknown.

## 7. Grim Reaper
